==> CSS:
	-- Flexbox:
		-- justify-content == main axis alignment
		-- align-items == cross axis alignment
		-- justify/align-self == overwrites parent div alignment
		-- flex => flex-grow/flex-shrink
			-- works with relative proportions
			-- percentual item size
				=> {item's flex} / {sum of 'flex' of parent div's children} 
	-- Properties:
		-- box-sizing: border-box; 
			--	Recalculates the size of div to subtract the border from the element
				width/height, makes it so adding a border to an element doesn't alter
				it's final size.
		--	1rem == 16px
	--	Pseudo-classes:
		--	Style applied to an element after an event/action
		--	Examples:
			--	:focus => when an input element is being actively used
			--	:hover => when the mouse is being hovered over an element
			--	:first-child => first child element of a parent element
			--	:last-child => last child element of a parent element
			--	:nth-child({number}) => nth child element of a parent element 
				--	:nth-child(odd) and :nth-child(even) provide useful utility too
			--	:not({selector})
				--	:not(:hover) 
					=> when the mouse is *not* being hovered over an element
			--	:focus-within 
					=> keeps a dropdown menu open even if one of it's items is clicked
